	Mobile Payment
	
	
	近年來由於行動通訊技術及行動網路的發展，使得行動付款成為可行的付款方式，以往的行動付款機制是透過行動網路進行資料的傳輸，近年來在無線科技與行動付款系統發展的潮流中，近端行動付款技術漸成熟，目前可以提供手持式設備使用行動交易的技術有近距離無線通訊(Near
	Field Communication, NFC)、紅外線、二維條碼等。由於NFC具有標準化的技術，且付款程序更簡單，因此使得NFC在應用於行動交易的服務領域時，具有較大的優勢，特別受到電信業者與消費者的重視與青睞。目前在許多國家，由當地業者負責進行NFC手機實驗計劃，除了測試相容性外，也試圖檢視消費者能否接受NFC手機所提供的應用服務。因此本研究希望結合學術理論來了解消費者利用手機進行近端行動交易的採用態度，並進一步探討影響消費者採用近端行動付款的關鍵因素。
	
	
	
	本研究首先整理了近端行動付款的相關議題，對近端行動付款服務之發展概況進行深入探討，找出可能影響近端行動付款之因素。研究架構以科技接受模型為基礎，融合創新擴散理論的創新產品概念，並加入知覺風險構面，探討影響消費者採用近端行動付款因素，期望能對消費者採用近端行動付款的行為有更完善的解釋。最後根據研究結果提出結論與建議，以供業者發展近端行動付款系統及經營模式之參考。
	
	
	In the recent years, due to the development of mobile devices and
	mobile networks, the mobile payment has become a feasible way for
	people to pay their bills. The proximity mobile payment has growed
	up in the current trend of wireless technology and the development
	of mobile payment recently. Several technologies, such as NFC (Near
	Field Communication), IrFM (Infra-red Financial Messaging), bar code
	etc., to offer the mobile device to use proximity mobile payment.
	Due to the standardization of technology and easier procedure of
	payment , NFC shows advantages in the proximity mobile payment field.
	In many countries, the local operators conduct the experiment plan
	of NFC mobile phone. Except for testing the compatibility and try
	to survey if consumers can accept the application of NFC mobile phone.
	Consequently, the study will use the science theory to realize consumers’
	attitude toward the proximity mobile payment and find out the key
	factors affecting the intention of consumers adopting proximity mobile
	payment. 
	
	
	At first we gather the relative discussions of proximity mobile payment
	to comprehend the development of proximity mobile payment. And then
	we choose Technology Acceptance Model as foundation framework and
	merge Diffusion of Innovation and Perceived Risk to find out the
	factors affecting the development of proximity mobile payment. We
	expect to explain the consumers’ behavior about adopting proximity
	mobile payment. Finally, according to the result we bring up the
	conclusion and suggestion for operators when they develop the system
	and business model of proximity mobile payment.},

  abstract = {本研究主要是應用延伸式科技接受模型(Extended TAM)為研究架構,探討消費
	
	者對線上投保人壽保險的態度與使用意願,並分析可能的影響因素。本研究所建構的
	
	延伸式 TAM 主要是在原始 TAM 架構中,加入相容性認知、自我效能、規範信念、以
	
	及信任等四個構念,成為一個擴充式的研究模型,用來解釋消費者對線上投保之態度
	
	與意願;而後以問卷調查方式搜集所需資料,並以迴歸分析方法驗證模型。驗證結果
	
	顯示,原始 TAM 中的有用性認知與易用性認知的影響並未如預期的顯著,反倒是本
	
	研究加入的相容性認知對線上投保態度的影響,以及信任、規範信念、與自我效能等
	
	三個構念對線上投保意願的影響相當顯著。這證實了原始 TAM 在描述某些複雜的科
	
	技採用行為時,如線上投保,確實有修正與延伸的必要。
	
	
	The purpose of this study is to predict consumer attitude and intention
	to purchase life
	
	insurance online by extending technology acceptance model (TAM). The
	way we extend
	
	TAM is to add four additional concepts: compatibility, normative beliefs,
	self-efficacy, and
	
	trust, into the original one. We use these four new concepts, along
	with two old ones, per-
	
	ceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, to predict consumer attitude
	and intention to
	
	purchase life insurance online. The empirical results show that the
	effects of the two original
	
	explanatory variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of
	use, are not as significant
	
	as generally expected. Instead, the four new concepts we add have
	fairly good performance
	
	in explaining attitude and intention. Specifically, the effect of
	compatibility on purchase atti-
	
	tude, and the effects of normative beliefs, self-efficacy, and trust
	on purchase intention are all
	
	very significant. Such results indicate that for certain types of
	consumer behavior, such as
	
	online in surance purchase, TAM may not be a good model to be used
	to predict consumer
	
	intention. Under these circumstances, TAM needs to be well modified
	so as to be adaptive to
	
	the specific behavior types.},
